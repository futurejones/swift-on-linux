# Swift on Linux
## *A Roadmap for the Future.*

A working group to provide methods and systems for the easy installation and distribution of the Swift Coding Language on Linux. This is to include as many of the different Linux distributions and CPU architectures as possible. Where possible this should be the standard installation process as used by other coding languages and applications on that system.

# Primary Functions
To design and document methods to enable the following:-
## **Installation**
Each Linux distribution has its own packaging system used for the easy installation, update and removal of items. The `swift.tar.gz` files will need to be converted to the appropriate package for each distribution.
### *Example*
>Ubuntu uses `aptitude`  
Packages use a `.deb` extension  
Installed with `sudo apt install <filename>.deb`

## **Distribution**


## **Promotion**


## **Bug Reporting**
